DirectConnect Support
PBDIR60.DLL will not connect due to problems that were identified 
after the final build for PB 6.5. The fixes for the Direct Connect 
driver will be posted on http://support.sybase.com. To install the 
fix, rename the file installed with PB 6.5, download the file 
PBDIR60.DLL and replace the one installed with PB 6.5.
